            <p class="bg-p">
                i'm sydney, but sometimes i go by mara. i am 19 and live in north carolina. i moved
                here from idaho when i was 18. right now, i work as a baker, i make lots of breads 
                and pastries. it's easy and fun, and pays the bills but i don't want to do it forever.
                growing up, i always had a strong interest in computers and technology. in high school,
                i took every computer class that was offered. it was a small town, and there weren't a lot
                of options, but one of them was a web development class. i really don't remember much from 
                the class, but i do remember enjoying it the most out of the different classes i took.
                despite that, it didn't click in my head that i could have a career surrounding web development,
                and coding in genereal. when it did click, i started researching different ways of getting to a place
                to have a career, and that is when i found Coding Temple. it was the perfect option and so now here
                i am!
